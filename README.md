## Overview

This project was inspired by a friend who coaches volleyball always having to manually enter data into a stat website. 
I wanted to build something to make data entry for them and other coaches more straight-forward and simple.
This tool provides a user-friendly interface for uploading stat files and and then you can click on the player for which data to add.

## Features

- **Upload File:** Upload a stat file to parse and display stats.
- **Redirects**: Using the short URL redirects users to the original long URL.
- **User-Friendly:** Clear all and concise UI/UX.
- **Dark Mode:** Stylish dark mode interface for comfortable viewing.
